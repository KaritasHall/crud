## To-do list app (REST API)

Live site: https://crud-project-930c5.web.app/

For this project I wanted to try Firebase, essentially working with a FERN stack. Firebase is quite similar to MongoDB in the sense that it offers NoSQL database hosting. The database (called Firestore) is however only one of the features Firebase offers, it is basically a suite where you can use multiple tools to develop a fullstack application. What drew me to Firebase (aside from the database) is the option to host your server and website. What that means is that you can host your server in the Firebase cloud rather than on localhost - which means that your users can actually interact with the application.

When you visit the live site, you should be able to see some tasks that I have already added as they are stored in the NoSQL database. Anyone with a link to the site can add/delete/edit. So feel free to delete the task, and add some new ones.
